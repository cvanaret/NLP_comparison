# Comparison of nonlinear optimization solvers 

This repo aims at collecting results of nonlinear optimization solvers on standard benchmark problems. So far, it contains the following results:

* 429 small problems of the CUTEst dataset. The AMPL models were taken [here](https://arnold-neumaier.at/glopt/coconut/Benchmark/Library2_new_v1.html) and may differ from the original CUTEst models in SIF format

for the following solvers:

* CONOPT 3.17A
* filterSQP (20020316)
* IPOPT 3.12.8
* IPOPT 3.14.11
* LANCELOT
* LOQO 7.03
* MINOS 5.51
* SNOPT 7.5-1.2
* [Uno 1.0](https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno)
